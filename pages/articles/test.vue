        <h1>Using design to grow revenue</h1>
        <p>If you work at a startup or run an online business, making your website pretty isn't the end goal. You want to grow. More clicks, sign ups, revenue, whatever.
          Here's one trick I use to increase conversions.
          At the start of a site redesign I'll look at each page and remove or move any unnecessary elements. I’m ruthless about it. If something is on the page that doesn’t help the user complete a goal, it’s gone.
