        <h1>Use two fonts in your design</h1>
        <p>Using too many fonts will hurt your website design. It adds unneeded complexity. So keep it simple and use two fonts. A serif and sans serif will work, but two serifs (or two sans serifs) can also work if they look different enough from one another.
        </p>

        <p>Donâ€™t use three or more fonts unless you have a good reason. A few years ago I designed a site for a tech company that need to show code snippets throughout their site. Neither of the two fonts I was using looked good in code. So I introduced a third font just for the snippets. In this instance, making the code easy to read was more important than the gestalt of the entire site.</p>

        <p>That was an exception to the rule that made sense. But usually, two fonts is best.</p>
