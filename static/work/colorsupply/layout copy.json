        "Some tools like <a href='https://color.adobe.com' target='_blank'>Adobe Kuler </a> enable users to create colors at an atomic level. They're like a sniper rifle â€“ they provide precise control but it comes at the expense of speed. That control is helpful if you have a color palette already in mind that you want to modify. But my research indicated most people picked colors from scratch.",
