With this in mind, we worked with Francesca's to re-imagine their brand as a helpful big sister to help their young customers navigate the early years of adolescence.",

        "But at the same time, the company didn't want to alienate the parents of these young women. We came up with a brand direction which tested very well with young women and their parents. It was hipper, but not too hip.",
       "Since these young women were still figuring out their sense of style, we wanted to hold their hand a bit â€“ much like a big sister."
