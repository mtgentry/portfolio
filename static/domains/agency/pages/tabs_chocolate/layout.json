I once worked on a TV campaign that aired in select markets in the midwest. It was designed to increase sales. The client spent a few million dollars for the air time. After the ads ran I asked our account guy how they performed. He said sales were up in some stores and down in others. After several million dollars spent! The client could have done nothing at all and still had the same result.",
