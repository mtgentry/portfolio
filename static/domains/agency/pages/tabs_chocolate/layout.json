        "On the other hand, some people only care about the brand. They want to make good-looking work and don't want it to be questioned. These are often designers in Brooklyn who want to win awards and don't care about if your site makes money. If you test a simple homepage against theirs, the simple version will often do better.",
        "The takeaway is NOT that ugly designs convert better. If you were to come up with a third version that is well designed and optimized, it would likely convert the best.",
